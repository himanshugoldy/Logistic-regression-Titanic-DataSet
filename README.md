# Logistic-regression-Titanic-DataSet
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
Since some of the passengers data was missing i have done data analysis on the given data and filled the respective fields.The model should predict whether the passenger survived or not so i have used Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithm to train and test my data and predict results.Some of the data like name,sex,address,ticket,Embarked are categorical data so i have managed to remove the data which is not necessary to find out what happened to our passengers and rest of the data i have made into numbers to train ML Algorithm.
